# Professional-Portfolio
This is my personal professional portfolio where you will fnd all my unique websites projects done, future webpages develop and more.
As a introduction a globl picture was utilized to communicate my service will be provided globaly.
Used a scaling element to give that alive ilusion to the page in many cases (preference) because is eye catchie.
Used a compound of elements to get font sizes, background, page background and font-background.

In the 'About Me' you will find a picture taken by me to utilize as 'who am I' and gave a brief introduction about myself.
Also included a chat  element for the customer to be able to contact me.


In my Service I made it look like if I had projects listed for the customer to get an idea of how my works look and future projects. Advertice how I could be able to come out with difference ideas from business to gaming (as example).

Footer I encourage the customer to in contact with me for future business and my LinkIn link to get in business and a (Hire me) button.
Added my own copyright since is my own page.
I used multiple color to make it look alive and fun; also made the intro page "business professional" to show versatility. A Bit mixed but a taste for both fields.
